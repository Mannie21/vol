              Eagles are large birds of prey known for their impressive size, strength, and keen eyesight. They belong to the family Accipitridae and are found on almost every continent. Here's some information about the habitat and lifestyle of eagles: <br><br>

<strong>Habitat:</strong> <br>
1. Diverse Environments: Eagles are adaptable and can be found in a wide range of habitats, depending on the species. They can be found in mountains, forests, deserts, grasslands, and near water bodies like rivers, lakes, and coastlines. <br>
2. Nesting Sites: Eagles typically prefer to nest in tall trees or on cliffs, which provide a vantage point for hunting and protection for their young. <br>
3. Geographical Distribution: Different species of eagles have different geographic ranges. For example, the bald eagle is found in North America, the African fish eagle in sub-Saharan Africa, and the golden eagle in North America, Europe, and Asia. <br><br>

<strong>Lifestyle:</strong> <br>
1. Hunting and Diet: Eagles are carnivorous predators. They primarily feed on fish, small mammals, birds, reptiles, and occasionally carrion. Some larger eagle species, such as the golden eagle, can even prey on larger animals like deer and goats. <br>
2. Flight and Soaring: Eagles are renowned for their exceptional flying abilities. They have strong wings and can soar at high altitudes, often using thermal updrafts to conserve energy while searching for prey. <br>
3. Breeding and Mating: Eagles are generally monogamous and form long-term pair bonds. They build large nests called eyries, where they lay their eggs and raise their young. Both parents participate in incubating the eggs and caring for the chicks. <br>
4. Territorial Behavior: Eagles are territorial birds. They defend their nesting territories from other eagles and potential threats. They use aerial displays, such as soaring together or engaging in high-speed chases, to assert dominance or deter intruders. <br>
5. Long Lifespan: Eagles have relatively long lifespans compared to many other bird species. Depending on the species and environmental factors, they can live up to 20-30 years in the wild, with some species known to live even longer in captivity. <br>

It's important to note that while these characteristics generally apply to eagles as a group, specific behaviors and preferences can vary among different eagle species.

              10 things you did not know about eagles

            <div class="accordion-body">
              1. Speed and Agility: Eagles are incredibly fast and agile birds. They can reach speeds of up to 100 miles per hour (160 kilometers per hour) during a high-speed dive or stoop to catch prey. <br>

              2. Powerful Talons: Eagles have sharp, strong talons that allow them to grip and carry prey. The gripping power of an eagle's talons is estimated to be several hundred pounds per square inch, enabling them to snatch and carry prey that may be heavier than their own body weight. <br>
              
              3. Excellent Eyesight: Eagles have exceptional vision, which allows them to spot prey from great distances. Their eyes are specially adapted to provide sharp focus and enhanced color perception. They have a higher density of photoreceptor cells than humans, enabling them to see fine details even from high altitudes. <br>
              
              4. Long-distance Migration: Some eagle species undertake long-distance migrations, covering thousands of miles each year. For example, the steppe eagle and the booted eagle migrate from their breeding grounds in Europe and Asia to spend the winter in Africa. <br>
              
              5. Acrobatic Courtship Displays: Eagles engage in elaborate courtship displays, which involve aerial acrobatics and impressive flight maneuvers. These displays demonstrate their strength, agility, and bond with their mate. <br>
              
              6. Massive Nests: Eagle nests, known as eyries, are among the largest bird nests in the animal kingdom. Some eagle species build nests that can be several meters in diameter and weigh hundreds of kilograms. These nests are often used and expanded upon by the same pair of eagles for multiple breeding seasons. <br>
              
              7. Fierce Competitors: Eagles are highly territorial and fiercely defend their hunting territories and nesting sites from intruders, including other eagles. These territorial disputes can involve dramatic aerial battles and fierce clashes. <br>
              
              8. Symbolic Significance: Eagles have significant cultural and symbolic importance in many human societies. They are often associated with power, freedom, and majesty. As a result, eagles are frequently used as national symbols and appear on flags, emblems, and currency in various countries. <br>
              
              9. Lifespan and Survival: While eagles are long-lived birds, their survival is not guaranteed. They face threats such as habitat loss, pollution, electrocution from power lines, and illegal hunting. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect eagle populations around the world. <br>
              
              10. Impressive Dive Speeds: Eagles are known for their breathtaking aerial dives, known as stoops. During a stoop, an eagle tucks its wings and plummets towards its prey, reaching incredible speeds. The peregrine falcon holds the title for the fastest animal in the world, but some large eagle species can also achieve impressive speeds during their dives. <br>

              Certainly! Here are some frequently asked questions about eagles: <br> <br>

              1. <strong> What is the largest species of eagle?</strong> <br>
              The largest species of eagle is the Stellar's sea eagle (Haliaeetus pelagicus). It is found in northeastern Asia and can have a wingspan of up to 8 feet (2.4 meters) and weigh up to 20 pounds (9 kilograms). <br>
              
              2. <strong>How long do eagles live?</strong> <br>
              The lifespan of eagles varies among species. On average, eagles in the wild can live for 20-30 years, although some species have been known to live longer. For example, bald eagles have been documented to live up to 40 years in the wild. <br>
              
              3. <strong>Are eagles endangered?</strong> <br>
              The conservation status of eagles varies depending on the species and location. Some species, such as the bald eagle, have recovered from endangered status and are now considered of least concern. However, other species, like the Philippine eagle, remain critically endangered due to habitat loss and hunting. <br>
              
              4. <strong>Do eagles mate for life?</strong> <br>
              Many eagle species are monogamous and form long-term pair bonds. Once they find a mate, they typically stay together for multiple breeding seasons, often for life. <br>
              
              5. <strong>How do eagles hunt?</strong> <br>
              Eagles use various hunting techniques, depending on the species and prey. They primarily rely on their exceptional eyesight to spot prey from high altitudes. Once they have located their target, they may soar or perch, then execute a swift dive or stoop to catch the prey using their powerful talons. <br>
              
              6. <strong>Can eagles swim?</strong> <br>
              While eagles are not adapted for swimming, they are capable of swimming short distances if necessary. They can use their wings for propulsion and their feet for steering in the water. However, swimming is not a common behavior for eagles. <br>
              
              7. <strong>How many eggs do eagles lay?</strong> <br>
              The number of eggs eagles lay depends on the species. Typically, eagles lay one to three eggs per clutch. However, some species may lay only one egg, while others may lay up to four eggs. <br>
              
              8. <strong>Are all eagles migratory?</strong> <br>
              Not all eagle species are migratory. Some eagles, such as the bald eagle, are known for their migratory behavior, while others, like the golden eagle, may be partially migratory or remain in their breeding territories year-round. <br>
              
              9. <strong>Are all eagles migratory?</strong> <br>
              Eagles are diurnal birds, meaning they are most active during the day. While they have excellent vision, their hunting and flying activities are primarily restricted to daylight hours. <br>
              
              10. <strong>Are eagles social birds?</strong> <br>
              Eagles are generally solitary birds, but they can tolerate the presence of other eagles within their territories, especially their mates during the breeding season. However, they are known to fiercely defend their territories from intruders.
